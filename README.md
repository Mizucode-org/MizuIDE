# Mizu Code

**Mizu Code** is a lightweight, local-first code editor built for developers who want to write code without managing prompts, background services, or remote dependencies.

It is currently in **early alpha**.

---

## Philosophy

Modern editors are increasingly optimized around cloud services and AI-driven workflows.  
Mizu Code takes a different approach.

- No mandatory AI features
- No background telemetry
- No remote execution
- No hidden services

The editor is designed to be predictable, fast, and transparent.  
If a feature cannot run locally and reliably, it does not belong in the core editor.

---

## Current Status

Mizu Code is under active development and **not feature-complete**.

This alpha release exists to validate:
- core editor architecture
- startup performance
- input latency
- stability under real usage

Breaking changes, incomplete modules, and missing functionality are expected.

---

## What Exists Today

- Lightweight editor core
- Fast startup and low memory usage
- Syntax highlighting
- Basic file navigation
- Minimal, distraction-free UI

Everything runs locally. No network access is required.

---

## What Does Not Exist (Yet)

- Extension system
- Advanced language tooling
- Collaborative features
- Built-in AI or autocomplete models
- Cloud sync or accounts

These omissions are intentional at this stage.

## Final Note

Mizu Code is built to stay out of your way.

No hype.  
No automation theater.  
Just a tool that lets you think.

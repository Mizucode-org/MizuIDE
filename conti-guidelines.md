# Contributing to Mizu Code

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mizu Code.

This project is intentionally minimal and opinionated. Contributions are welcome, but they must align with the project’s goals and current stage of development.

Please read this document before opening an issue or pull request.

---

## Project Status

Mizu Code is in **early alpha**.

This means:
- internal APIs may change
- features may be removed or rewritten
- stability is still being evaluated

Expect iteration. Do not expect guarantees.

---

## Before You Contribute

Before proposing changes, ask yourself:

- Does this improve performance, clarity, or stability?
- Does this keep the editor local-first and predictable?
- Does this avoid adding background services or hidden behavior?

If the answer is no, the change is unlikely to be accepted.

## What We Are Looking For

Contributions that are especially helpful at this stage:

- Bug reports with clear reproduction steps
- Performance improvements
- Code cleanup and simplification
- Documentation improvements
- Small, focused fixes

Quality matters more than quantity.

---

## What We Are Not Looking For (Yet)

The following are intentionally out of scope for now:

- Built-in AI features or cloud integrations
- Telemetry, analytics, or tracking
- Large feature additions without prior discussion
- Opinionated redesigns of core architecture

These decisions may change later, but not during early alpha.

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, please include:

- Operating system and version
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior

Incomplete reports may be closed for clarity.

## Submitting Pull Requests

If you submit a pull request:

- Keep changes small and focused
- Explain **why** the change is needed

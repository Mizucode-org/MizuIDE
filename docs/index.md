# Introduction

## What is Mizu Code
Mizu Code is a code editor. It runs on your computer. It does not need internet. It does not need an account.

It is in alpha. It has bugs. Some features are missing.

## How it works
The editor runs locally. No data is sent anywhere. No background services run without your knowledge.
